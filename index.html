<!-- Biography --> 
<section id="About-me">
    <h2 class = "Heading2_centered">About me</h2>

    <p id = "bio"> I am a fourth year biomedical engineering student at the University of British Columbia specializing in biomechanics and biomaterials. I have 6+ years of coding experience in various programming languages such as C, C#, R, MATLAB and more. I am curious, adaptable and a quick learner. <br> <br>
    My current project is actually building this website, but my interest in programming ultimately began in highschool when I made a minigame: <br>

     <br><br>
    In my free time, I love to try new foods, play hockey and basketball, and embark on short ski/board trips in the winter. I also enjoy spending time hiking or hitting the beach with my dog. </p>

        <div class="column1">
          <p><span class = "Heading3_centered"> <b> Hip Joint Range of Motion in Cerebral Palsy Patients </b></span> <br>
          This year, I investigated the decreased hip flexion and knee inversion apparent in Cerebral Palsy patients using 3-D kinematics. This project provided me with valuable experience applying knowledge acquired in academia to hands-on experimentation in order to generate interpretable results.

        <div class="column1">
          <p><span class = "Heading3_centered"> <b> Costco: </b></span> <br>
            In the summer of 2021, I worked a seasonal position at Costco as a stockboy. I would collaborate with 1-3 people to restock different sections of the warehouse. Through this experience, I developed teamwork skills that would help me communicate effectively to achieve success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="column1">
          <p><span class = "Heading3_centered"> <b> Web Development </b></span> <br>
          In the summer of 2022, I began building this website from the ground up. I began by reading some introductory articles about HTML and CSS, then once I had the basics down I started to make more and more progress throughout the year. I learned so much while self learning this material about everything from displaying "Hello World" on a blank page to publishing the website to Github Pages.

        <div class="column1">
          <p><span class = "Heading3_centered"> <b> Chang & Company: </b></span> <br> 
            In 2020, I assisted part-time with office duties at Chang & Company including filing, data input into Excel and Word, and Intuit Profile tax software. I learned a lot of data management skills especially in Excel from my time here.</p>

        <div class="column1">
          <p><span class = "Heading3_centered"> <b> Orthopaedic Implant </b></span> <br>
          In 2021, I collaborated with a team to design an orthopaedic femur implant and created a virtual model of the design on which we ran stress and deformation simulations (Solidworks). Through this experience, I further developed my skills in both Solidworks as well as the engineering design process.

          <p><span class = "Heading3_centered"> <b> KUMON Math and Reading </b></span><br>
          In 2019, I took up a part time job at KUMON to help kids of all ages with math and reading to fulfill their learning potential. Throughout this experience I frequently marked numerous assignments simultaneously often under time pressure, and consequently became an efficient worker under pressure. I also reported students' progress to their parents and developed communication skills as a result. </p>
