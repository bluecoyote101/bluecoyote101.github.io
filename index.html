          In 2019, I took up a part time job at KUMON to help kids of all ages with math and reading to fulfill their learning potential. Throughout this experience I frequently marked numberous assignments simultaneously often under time pressure, and consequently became an efficient worker under pressure. I also reported students' progress to their parents and developed communication skills as a result. </p>
